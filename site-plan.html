        Hello, I am Trevor Bolles. 
        I am a current student at BYU-I studying Computer Science. I have always had a love
        for Computers and computer programming since I was little. I have pursued this passion
        throughout my life in various forms, from robotics to machine learning and Discord app development.

        I have been working with small teams to develop projects since I was in 6th grade. Over the course of that
        time, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the field of computer science. I am particularly interested in machine learning and have participated in a published experiment on the topic, exploring its applications in various domains.

        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also developed several Discord bots and applications. These projects have allowed me to enhance my programming skills and gain experience in building scalable and user-friendly applications.

        Robotics has been another area of focus for me. I have participated in robotics competitions and camps throughout my life, where I have learned about hardware integration, programming robots, and problem-solving in a team environment.

        On this website, you will find more information about my projects in machine learning, Discord app development, and robotics. Feel free to explore and learn more about my work.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        In this section, I will showcase some of the projects I have worked on. Here are a few highlights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>White Paper on Machine Learning</h4>
          <p>
        I have written a comprehensive white paper on machine learning, exploring its applications in various domains. The paper discusses different algorithms, techniques, and real-world use cases. It showcases my research and analytical skills in the field of artificial intelligence.

        <li>
          <h4>Discord App Development</h4>
          <p>
            I have developed several Discord bots and applications that enhance the user experience and provide useful functionalities. 
            These projects involve integrating APIs, handling user interactions, and creating intuitive interfaces. 
            They demonstrate my proficiency in web development and my ability to create engaging and interactive applications.

            my first project that has undergone 2 different versions was blubbert, blubbert is a bot that is meant to be simple in use that allows users to 
            interact with and have him say funny things to certain triggers. The second edition of blubbert allowed him to learn new things to say to users.

          <h4>Robotics Projects</h4>
          <p>
        I have been actively involved in robotics, participating in competitions and camps. These experiences have allowed me to apply my programming skills to control robots, solve complex challenges, and collaborate with team members. I have gained hands-on experience in hardware integration, sensor programming, and autonomous navigation.
        my primary experience in the robotics field was when I was growing up participating in the junior FLL leagues that used Lego Mindstorms to preform different tasks. The projects that I worked on involved a pathfinding robot and a sumo wrestling robot.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Not everything I like to do involves computers. I also enjoy playing video games, reading books, 
        going hiking, playing board games, and playing the piano and the viola.
