                Not everything I like to do involves computers. I also enjoy playing video games, reading books, 
                going hiking, playing board games, and playing the piano and the viola.

                    I have been playing viola for about 10 years now. I started playing in 6th grade and have been playing ever since. 
                    I have played in many different orchestras growing up both in school and through a program called the tacoma youth
                    symphony and have played in many different concerts and venues over those years. 
                    I have participated in solo and ensemble competitions with friends and family and worked really hard to develop those skills.

                    Backpacking was something that was a constant throughout my life.
                    I have been on many trips but I would say my favorite two spots would have to be a section of the
                    pacific crest trail in washington state and hiking the great chinese wall in montana.
