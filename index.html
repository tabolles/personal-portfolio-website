                Hello, I am Trevor Bolles. 
                I am a current student at BYU-I studying Computer Science. I have always had a love
                for Computers and computer programming since I was little. I have pursued this passion
                throughout my life in various forms, from robotics to machine learning and Discord app development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been working with small teams to develop projects since I was in 6th grade. Over the course of that
                time, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the field of computer science. I am particularly interested in 
                machine learning and have participated in a published experiment on the topic, exploring its applications in various domains.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also developed several Discord bots and applications. 
                These projects have allowed me to enhance my programming skills and gain experience in building 
                scalable and user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robotics has been another area of focus for me. I have participated in robotics competitions 
                and camps throughout my life, where I have learned about hardware integration, 
                programming robots, and problem-solving in a team environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website, you will find more information about my projects in machine learning, Discord app development, and robotics. 
                Feel free to explore and learn more about my work.
            </p>
